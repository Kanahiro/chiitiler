# chiitiler - Tiny VectorTile rendering server

chii-tiler

"tiny" in Japanese is "chiisai", shorten this into "chii"

## motivation

- In this type of server, there is a de-facto - [maptiler/tileserver-gl](https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl), but this is too big for me.
- I want a server accept style.json-url and respond raster tile, inspired by [developmentseed/titiler](https://github.com/developmentseed/titiler)

## status

- this project is under development and experiment
